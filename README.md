## Topic
Implementing K-Means Clustering Algorithm in QT Creator for Dataset Analysis
## Requirements
1. The application should be created with QT Creator IDE.
2. The application should have a user interface so that users can easily upload and view datasets.
3. Users should have the option to specify how many clusters they want the K Means algorithm to find.
4. The app should allow users to customize K Means algorithm parameters such as the number of iterations and convergence threshold.
5. The app must use the K Means clustering algorithm to divide the dataset into the chosen number of clusters.
6. The algorithm generated clusters should be shown on a scatter plot, with colors for each cluster.
7. Information about each cluster, such as centroid and size should be available in the app.
8. Users should be able to save results and analysis reports.
9. Error handling features are necessary in case of inputs or unexpected situations.
10. For user guidance, instructions on using and interpreting results should be included in the documented app.
